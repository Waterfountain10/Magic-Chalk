# Magic Chalk - Interactive Whiteboard Application

Magic Chalk is an interactive whiteboard application developed using Python. It employs technologies like Streamlit for the web interface, OpenCV for image processing, and MediaPipe for hand gesture recognition. This application allows users to draw, erase, solve mathematical equations, and save their work with hand gestures.

## Installation & Dependencies
Before running the application, ensure that you have the following libraries installed:
- Streamlit
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- NumPy
- WolframAlpha API
  - Make sure you have an API key

You can install them using pip:
```bash
pip install streamlit opencv-python mediapipe numpy wolframalpha
```

## Train Model
You can download this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sagyamthapa/handwritten-math-symbols/code) to train your model
- There is already a model that you can use to train, however you might need to install other dependencies

#### N.B.
- Only keep 0-9, + - รท x
- Delete .directory in the main folder and in folder 9

## Start & Usage
